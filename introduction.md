# Biography

Hello!  My name is Rachel and I am excited to be a student in this data science course.  I graduated with a BA in Psychology a year ago with no clue what my career would look like.  I took a job in healthcare for a year, and soon I was married and moving to a new state!  I decided this was the perfect time to start the next step in my career path.  I had been looking into data science and I decided to make the leap.

# What I hope to gain from this course

I hope to gain a few things from this course:

1. An understanding of what a career in data science looks like
2. A good grasp on the important skills needed to succeed in data science
3. An idea of how to start my career in data science

# What challenges I anticipate facing

Having just moved to a new state, life is a little crazy.  I also have zero background in anything related to data science, so I'm working hard to learn from scratch.

# What strategies I will use to overcome these challenges

I plan to stick to a strict calendar that will allow me to move through the course at an appropriate pace, as well as give me time for supplemental learning.  I'm starting from zero, so I know this will take me extra time, which I have accounted for.  I also have time scheduled out to work on my project and research data science careers.

# My capstone project ideas

I've already come up with my project ideas, but I'm still working through them.

1. How to find reasonably  priced hospital services?
2. How much of a liability is a particular driver to an insurance company?
3. How can we determine the likelihood someone will survive a heart attack?

I'm really interested in insurance and I would like to come up with something that would be helpful for insurance companies.  I would love to do something health care related, since I have experience, but a lot of that data is difficult to find or difficult to understand.  I therefore decided to also include something related to car insurance, as that's another large insurance industry and there is a lot of data available.
