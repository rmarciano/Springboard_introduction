## Unit 1: Getting Started

### 1.1 Demystifying data science

For a fairly good overview of data science methods, read through [this blog post](http://www.thearling.com/text/dmtechniques/dmtechniques.htm). (This page can no longer be found) It provides a good overview of the many methods used in data science. It’s not a complete list, though; “data science” is a pretty broad umbrella.

What's a day in the life of a data scientist like? KDNuggets [has you covered](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/11/day-life-data-scientist.html), and Springboard [steps through the data science process](https://medium.springboard.com/the-data-science-process-the-complete-laymans-guide-to-what-a-data-scientist-actually-does-ca3e166b7c67).

Hadley Wickham is the creator of ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and other packages that you'll use in this course, and there are a couple of nice [Quora answers on how he works](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Hadley-Wickham-able-to-contribute-so-much-to-R-particularly-in-the-form-of-packages).

#### My experience

Every project is a different, but if I had to budget time for a generic project, it would look something like:

* 40% collecting and wrangling data
* 25% writing and graphing for reporting
* 25% EDA and analysis
* 10% organizing and documenting analysis projects (mainly for future re-use and reproducibility)

Collecting and wrangling data often takes much longer than analyzing it does. By some estimates, as much as 80% of a data scientist's time is spent wrangling. Writing up results for reports or presentations can take as long as the analysis itself, especially if you put the time into good writing and good visualizations that your work&mdash;and your customer (or client)&mdash;deserves. Finally, a small but not insignificant amount of time needs to go into keeping your work organized. You, and your colleagues, will thank you later for this effort.

### 1.2 Start thinking about your Capstone Project

Capstone projects are intended to assess your ability to apply the DS1 tool set, and your affinity for using data science to answer interesting questions. Most of the work will be done in Unit 9, so we have time and flexibility to figure out what you want to work on.

Start with Springboard's Capstone Project Guidelines (the PDF in Unit 1.2), and take the time to follow the links. Then read through the Springboard blog post [the Complete Layman's Guide to what a Data Scientist Actually Does](https://medium.springboard.com/the-data-science-process-the-complete-laymans-guide-to-what-a-data-scientist-actually-does-ca3e166b7c67), which lays out a process that you can follow for your project.

If your employer doesn't have a dataset that you want to work on, finding data can be challenging for new data scientists. In addition to the data sources listed in the Project Guidelines, I provide an [annotated and organized list of potential data sources](Project_ideas_and_data_sources.md).
